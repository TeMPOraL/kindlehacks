#+title: Development Notes

This document will store ideas, notes, todos, etc. - this way I can declutter README file ;).

* Presentation

It would be nice to keep everything under 600 lines of code. There was a post by (I think)
Jeff Atwood about how much one can do in 600 lines of code. Let's see if I can finish this
project under this limit ;).

Well, this goal seems to be not too difficult - most important features are already working
and I'm still around 300 effective lines of code.

** Webapp
*** TODOs

**** TODO Make a presentation-time clock.
     It would be a local clock that could be reset by pressing a proper key.
**** TODO Add a nice stylesheet.
	 Presentation title should be centered, clocks should be on the both sides of the page.
**** TODO Fix site heading (either remove or make it dynamically set)
**** TODO Implement presentation clock resetting.
**** TODO Fix notes so that we can use a html text.
**** TODO Simple authorization (cookie based) for clients.

*** DONEs
**** DONE Implement TCP communication part.
**** DONE Test [[http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onkeypress.asp][Javascript onkeypress() event]].
**** DONE Implement notes.
	 We can actually store all notes client-side and let (presentation) server update it only when there were some changes introduced to notes.
	 Note switching would then be completely client-side.

**** DONE Reformat the text of the wall-clock (we don't need the full names of timezone and daylight saving mode)
**** DONE Design a note-passing protocol that would allow sending multi-line notes.

** Actuator
*** TODOs
*** DONEs
*** DONE Implement keypress simulation (Win32)

** Transport format
*** TODO Make it more secure against hacking.
	Maybe. With cookie-based authorization it might not be worth spending time on.
