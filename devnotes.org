#+title: Development Notes

This document will store ideas, notes, todos, etc. - this way I can declutter README file ;).

* Presentation

** Webapp
*** TODOs

**** TODO Make a presentation-time clock.
**** TODO Implement TCP communication part.
**** TODO Add a nice stylesheet.
	 Presentation title should be centered, clocks should be on the both sides of the page.
**** TODO Reformat the text of the wall-clock (we don't need the full names of timezone and daylight saving mode)
**** TODO Fix site heading (either remove or make it dynamically set)
**** TODO Implement presentation clock resetting.
**** TODO Implement notes.
	 We can actually store all notes client-side and let (presentation) server update it only when there were some changes introduced to notes.
	 Note switching would then be completely client-side.

*** DONEs
**** DONE Test [[http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onkeypress.asp][Javascript onkeypress() event]].

** Actuator

*** TODO Skech actuator architecture.
