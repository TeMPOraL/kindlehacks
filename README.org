#+title: Kindle Hacks

A general repository for my Kindle hacking ideas.

* Remote controlling a presentation via Kindle
The goal is to make a remote controller from Kindle. Because it seems
there's no easy way to make Kindle talk wirelessly to a computer
directly, this hack will require Internet access for both Kindle and
target computer.

The idea is to create a web app that will interface Kindle with target
computer, so that one could use Kindles build-in browser to control
the presentation.
