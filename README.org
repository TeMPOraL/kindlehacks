#+title: Kindle Hacks

* What is this?
A general repository for my Kindle hacking ideas.

* Subprojects
** Remote controlling a presentation via Kindle
The goal is to make a remote controller from Kindle. Because it seems
there's no easy way to make Kindle talk wirelessly to a computer
directly, this hack will require Internet access for both Kindle and
target computer.

*** Webapp
The idea is to create a web app that will interface Kindle with target
computer, so that one could use Kindles build-in browser to control
the presentation.

**** TODO Test [[http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onkeypress.asp][Javascript onkeypress() event]].

*** Actuator
This component will be responsible for issuing commands to
presentation software by ie. faking keystrokes.

**** TODO Skech actuator architecture.
